		<h1>Motivation Letter</h1>
		<p>
			First of all, I really hope that you are willing to take English-speaking foreigners as applicants for Systek!
			But in case you are not, I am willing to take the chance and try to change your mind anyways :)
		</p>
		<h3>Why Norway?</h3>
		<p>
			Because Money!! I'm kidding. I'm very aware that eventhough Norway has one of the highest salaries
			in the world, there are other countries with higher "income disposal" but anyways that is still not the most
			appealing aspect about Norway for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			The thing I like the most about Norway is that Income Inequality is very low. If we take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini Coefficient</a> as measurement, Norway has the best one of the best ones: 22.3[1]
		</p>
		<p>
			It shows that for each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage pregnancies, and child well-being, outcomes are significantly worse in more unequal rich countries[2].
		</p>
		<p>
			I think that living in a country with such charactestics should be very beneficial for my well being, and therefore my interest in living in Norway.
		</p>
		<h3>Why ?</h3>
		<p>
			Well, it seems Systek has all what I'm looking for =) 
		</p>
		<h3>Why me?</h3>
		<p>
			I'm convinced that I have the competences, skills, experience and good attitude to be able to contribute to Systek's goals and projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			For me it's not enough that the code works but that it's also scalable and easy to maintain, in other words that the code "looks pretty". This means that I appreciate very much code reviews from peers, because they might see things that I miss. I think it is much faster to learn with others than by myself, and better code gets done when there is collaboration and sharing of knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also mention on my CV that my experience in <a href="http://aiesec.org">AIESEC</a>, that I had during my universoty years, has provided me with skills in Strategic Planning, and also with competences such as Integrity, Self-awareness and Cultural understanding among others. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I can't emphasise enough the good attitude that I have for this new challenges that I'm looking for! I think this is very important to make the whole process smoothier and positive in general.
		</p>
